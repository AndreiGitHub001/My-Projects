# 🚀 Welcome to My Coding Journey

Hey there! I’m a curious and committed developer who started coding at 13—and I’ve been hooked ever since. This repo is where I collect the projects I build as I grow my skills and explore the world of software development.

I believe coding is my way in life, and every file in this repo reflects that journey—from simple scripts to structured applications.

## 📚 What I’m Learning

I’m actively working through:

- 🐍 [100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- 🌐 [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
- 🧾 Finished: **Digital Savvy** by CompuScholar (Fundamentals of computing and digital skills)

## 🔍 Highlights From My Projects

Some of the cool stuff I’ve built so far:

- 🎯 **True/False Quiz Game** – built with Python OOP principles
- 🔐 **Caesar Cipher Tool** – basic encryption/decryption in Python
- 🔢 Logic-driven number manipulation mini-projects
- 🌍 Web basics – landing pages, forms, and styling with HTML & CSS

Each project is here for a reason: it either challenged me, taught me something new, or helped reinforce core concepts.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (So Far)

I’m building a solid foundation across both **backend and frontend** tools:

### 💻 Core Skills
- **Python**
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Git & GitHub**

### 🌐 Web Development
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

### 🧱 Full-Stack Tools
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**

I’m continuing to expand this list as I work through more advanced projects and combine these tools in real-world ways.

## 🤖 What's Next?

I’m especially excited about exploring **Generative AI**—tools like language models, image generation, and building smart apps. I plan to dive into AI and machine learning as soon as I’ve got a stronger foundation in full-stack development.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

This repository is my personal portfolio and growth tracker. It’s here to:

- Show my progression as a developer
- Keep all my small wins (and bugs I squashed!) in one place
- Act as a sandbox for building and experimenting
